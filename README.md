## Project Details
This project can be done as a group project with two or three students in a group.
1. (15 points) Data Collection: Select any topic that you are interested in.
Regarding this topic find some suitable data. This could be any data of your
own, or published data from a book or journal, or some data downloaded from
any website. The size of the data should be neither too small nor too large.
Cite the source of your data including any webpage address.

2. (100 points) Experimental Comparison of Numerical Algorithms: Im-
plement (in MATLAB or another high-level programming language) at least two
alternative algorithms (or three for groups of three students) to process your
data. You can select algorithms from any of the following groups (as suitable
to your data):

  - (a) Function interpolation methods. [Open for undergraduates only]
(These include Lagrange Interpolation Method, Newton’s Divided Differ-
ences Method, Piecewise Linear Interpolation, Piecewise Linear Approx-
imation, Piecewise Quadratic Interpolation, Cubic Spline Interpolation).
(Note: If you use Lagrange Interpolation or Newton’s Divided Differences
Method, which were implemented in an earlier homework, then you need
to implement two new methods beside those.)

  - (b) Spatial interpolation methods. (These include Shape Function Inter-
polation, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Bezier Interpolation.)

  - (c) Numerical integration methods. (These include the Upper and Lower
Bound Sum of Rectangles Methods, the Trapezoid Method, Simpson’s
Method, Romberg’s Method, and the Monte Carlo Method.) In the com-
parison, compare the accuracy using the same number of intervals and/or
the computational complexity.

  - (d) Methods of evaluating systems of linear equations. (These include
the naive Gaussian Method, and the Partial Pivoting Method.) In the
comparison of these methods, give the residual errors and the condition
numbers.

  - (e) Least squares approximation methods. (These include, linear, poly-
nomial and exponential least squares approximations.)

  - (f) Any other pair of numerical algorithms. (For example, root finding
methods. These need to be checked and approved by the instructor).


3. (25 points) Suppose your boss in a company asks you to evaluate the above
methods and write a summary and recommendation about which method to
use. In your slides, please include a summary of your computational exper-
iments’ results. Present your findings in a table, bar chart, or other visual
methods. Include in the comparison and discussion of any relevant information
about accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, include in your sum-
mary a statement about which algorithm you would recommend to others and
the reason for your recommendation.

4. (10 points) Make a class presentation about your project using powerpoint
slides. Before you upload your final project to Canvas, record your presentation
separately and provide a link to your video. Earlier class videos can be found
at class project examples. Some projects explicitly say ”440 class.” Some other
projects may be related to the 413 class but are interesting to see because there
are some overlaps.
Note: The source code submitted should be executed on CSE server. Provide a
”README” file that describes the source code for each problem and indicates how
to compile and execute each of your programs.
